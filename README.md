A Bayesian analysis of GW190521 with EM counterpart candidate.

If GW190521 and the electromagnetic counterpart candidate are assumed to be related, can redshifts from the BBH orbiting a SMBH explain the high primary and secondary mass? This assumtion allows for an independent measurement of the luminosity distance. 

Assume geometric units (G=c=1).

$velocity = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(\frac{r}{R_s}-1})}$

Where the velocity can be transformed to the velocity along the line of sight via geometry. 

The relativistic velocity (due to motion along the line the sight) is:

$z_{rel} = \gamma (1 + vel_{LoS}) - 1$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor

The gravitational redshift from the SMBH potential is:

$z_{grav} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{r}{R_s}}} - 1 $

The luminosity distance and effective chirp mass are thus transformed:

$D_{app} = (1+z_{grav})(1+z_{rel})^2D_L$

$M_{eff} = (1+z_c) (1 + z_{rel}) (1 + z_{grav}) M_C$
